  ## Step-by-Step Guide
  
  1. **Open the Project Page**  
     Visit the Modrinth, CurseForge, GitHub, or project website for the content you want to download.
  
  2. **Find the Versions or Files Section**  
     Look for a tab or section labelled **Versions**, **Files**, **Releases**, or **Downloads**.
  
  3. **Select Your Minecraft Version**  
     - Locate a list or dropdown called **Version**, **Game Version**, or **Supported Versions**.  
     - Pick the version that matches your Minecraft installation (e.g., *1.20.1*, *1.19.2*).
  
  4. **Choose the Correct File Type**  
     The file type depends on the kind of content:  
     - **Mods:** `.jar`  
     - **Plugins:** `.jar`  
     - **Addons (Bedrock):** `.mcaddon` / `.mcpack`  
     - **Texture Packs:** `.zip`  
     - **Data Packs:** `.zip` or extracted folder  
     - **Capes / Skin Addons:** whichever format the creator provides  
  
  5. **Download the File**  
     Click the **Download**, **Get**, or **File** button next to the version you need.  
     Save the file to your device.
  
  6. **Install According to Content Type**  
     - **Mods:** place the `.jar` inside `.minecraft/mods`.  
     - **Plugins:** move the `.jar` into your server’s `plugins` folder.  
     - **Texture Packs:** place the `.zip` into `.minecraft/resourcepacks`.  
     - **Data Packs:** put inside `world/datapacks`.  
     - **Addons (Bedrock):** double-click `.mcaddon` or `.mcpack` to import automatically.  
  
  7. **Restart Minecraft or Your Server**  
     Reload or restart to apply the new content.
